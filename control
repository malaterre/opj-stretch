Description: development files for OpenJPEG, a JPEG 2000 image library
 OpenJPEG is a library for handling the JPEG 2000 image compression format.
 JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard and permits progressive
 transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy for progressive downloads of an
 encoded image. It supports lossless and lossy compression, supports higher
 compression than JPEG 1991, and has resilience to errors in the image.
 .
 This package contains the development files for openjpeg 2.x

  - Scale up request: Enlarge the window
  - ROI request: Select a region by mouse click and drag, then click inside the
    red frame of the selected region
  - Annotate image with ROI information in XML metadata: Click button "Region
    Of Interest"
  - Open a new window presenting an aligned image with a locally stored image:
    Click button "Image Registration" (Under Construction)

Description: JPIP server for JPEG 2000 files
 OpenJPIP software is an implementation of JPEG 2000 Part9: Interactivity tools,
 APIs and protocols (JPIP). For more info about JPIP, check the website:
 http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/j2kpart9.html. The current implementation uses
 some results from the 2KAN project (http://www.2kan.org).
 .
 First Version covers:
 .
  - JPT-stream (Tile based) and JPP-stream (Precinct based) media types
  - Session, channels, cache model managements
  - JPIP over HTTP
  - Indexing JPEG 2000 files
  - Embedding XML formatted metadata
  - Region Of Interest (ROI) requests
